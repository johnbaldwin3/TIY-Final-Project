Nature APP (to be Named)

1.	WHAT THIS APP WILL DO:
A web application that will allow users to create, track, and compare their natural world observations by adding notes regarding (species, their observations, images, etc. all tied to their account).


2.	USER STORIES:

*Charles D.  is a budding naturalist who loves to explore the world. Charles will be able to enter the main splash marketing screen and create an account (and later login to his account) from the main page.

*After creating his account, he can share some details about the interests he has in the natural world and update his observer profile.

*After logging in, Charles will be able to view the main dashboard which will show the most recent observations from all users, a map corresponding to each observation location, and list of user rankings (based on amount of observations).
From this screen, Charles will be able to select an individual observation from any user and view the details thereof. Charles will also be able to select a dropped pin on the map feature which will take him to the corresponding observation details as well.

*Charles can also click on a user name (from rankings, or observation tiles) and view complete collection of that userâ€™s uploaded observations.

*Charles can user the navigation bar to check out the photo gallery comprised of all photos from every user. Clicking on a photo will take Charles back to the details of that observation.

*Charles will be able to create new observations tied to his account and upload a picture to each observation while sharing details about each observation he creates.
The website will then reach out to the GBIF API and then backfill species information including scientific name, taxonomical hierarchy, and the date of first discovery and the name of the discovering person.

*Charles will be able to update, edit, or delete, any of the observations tied to his username.

*Charles may also view the rankings page where all badges, points, etc. maybe accessed. On this page, there will be a filterable field to rank users based on different criteria.
Charles may edit his own personal profile at any given time as well, or view other user profiles.

*When Charles is done and feels like taking trip on the HMS Beagle, he can log out of his account if he wishes.
